# Install

Sorry for the long list of global components, we hope to solve this on a future update.

```npm install -g madnessenjin cordova ionic browser-sync gulp jade typescript typings jadelint sass-lint```

# Commands

There is only one command now, but there will soon be a lot more.

## start

- APP_NAME - The name of the application / folder

This will copy the boilerplate from http://github.com/madnesslabs/madnessionic into a folder with the APP_NAME provided and then run the npm install for you.

Example:

```enjin start APP_NAME```
